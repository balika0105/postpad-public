                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>The <i>PostPad</i> platform has to store some data about their users to provide the functionality it promises to users</p>
                <p>
                    The providers of the platform respect the privacy of their users, thus we only store as little personal information as possible, 
                    the stored data <i>mostly</i> relates to the platform itself
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Username: To identify the user of the platform and provide a unique name to the user</li>
                    <li>Password: To make the login more secure. Passwords are encrypted in the database</li>
                    <li>E-mail address: Provide a communication channel to the user in case of an important update to their profile (password reset, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Birthday: To decide if the user can see NSFW content on the platform</li>
                    <li>Day of signing up: Provide other functionality (Sign-up anniversary, year count badge)</li>
                    <li>Bio: A short text that the user provides so other users can see a short description of them (optional)</li>
                    <li>Website link: A hyperlink that can redirect to a website of their choosing (YouTube channel, Linktree page, etc.) (optional)</li>
                    <li>Private Profile value: If it is set to 1, the posts from that user aren't visible to the public, and only the user can decide who follows them</li>
                    <li>Timezone: Provide accurate information about when the visible posts were posted and other functionality</li>
                    <li>Payment information: If the user is subscribed to the paid tier, we will use this information to automatically bill for the next month (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="cookies"><small><a href="#cookies" class="marks">#</a></small> Cookies</h3>
                <p>As every website on the Internet, we also use cookies.</p>
                <p>
                    We use cookies to make users able to log in, and use our services. The cookies we store in the browser are only used for user identification,<br>
                    to provide information appropriately, based on who is using the service.<br>
                    Furthermore, by identifying the user, we can provide the appropriate functionalities to the user, based on their status. (regular user/patron/banned etc.)
                </p>
                <h4 id="promise"><small><a href="#promise" class="marks">#</a></small> What we promise</h3>
                <p>Our main principle is that we never sell our users' data to third parties.</p>
                <p>This is the reason why we provide a paid tier, so the users can support the operations of the platform</p>
                <p>It is planned to have some form of advertisements on the site, but they will be sandboxed and none of them will be able to track anything about the users</p>
