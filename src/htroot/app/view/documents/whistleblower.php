                <h2>Whistleblower's Protection Clause</h2>
                <p>
                    At <?php echo APP_NAME; ?>, we are committed to fostering a community that values transparency, ethical conduct, and the pursuit of justice.<br>
                    We recognize the importance of holding governments and large organizations accountable for their actions,<br>
                    especially when such actions involve violations of human rights, environmental degradation, or contributions to climate change.<br>
                    To encourage and safeguard individuals who bravely come forward to expose wrongdoings, we have established this Whistleblower's Protection Clause.
                </p>
                <br>

                        <h4 id="purpose"><small><a href="#purpose" class="marks">#</a></small> Purpose of Whistleblower's Protection</h4>
                        <p>
                            <?php echo APP_NAME; ?> and its provider firmly support users who choose to disclose information<br>
                            related to misconduct, unlawful activities, or unethical behavior committed by governments or large organizations.<br>
                            We believe that such disclosures play a crucial role in safeguarding society's welfare, human rights, and the environment.

                        <p>
                        We understand the sensitive nature of whistleblowing.<br>
                        Therefore, we are committed to protecting the identity of whistleblowers to the maximum extent.<br>

                        Users who report or expose information will be offered the option to remain anonymous,<br>
                        allowing them to share their concerns without fear of retaliation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To protect user identity our platform does not collect information about its users that could be tied to the user's real identity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, if a user is not cautious enough and uses...
                            <ul>
                                <li>their real name as their display name,</li>
                                <li>a photo of themselves as their profile picture,</li>
                                <li>their e-mail address contains their real name, or</li>
                                <li>their e-mail address provider is more known for convenience than privacy</li>
                            </ul>
                            the user can easily get tracked down this way. <br>

                            We encourage all of our users to stay vigilant and maximise their anonimity.

                            In situations where users decide to leak documents pertaining to alleged wrongdoing,<br>

                        The decision regarding whether leaked documents should remain visible on the platform will be made by our moderators.<br>
                        Factors considered will include the veracity of the information, potential harm or danger posed by the release of the documents, and adherence to our content guidelines.<br>
